# GIFtastic
CWRU Boot Camp assignment - Ajax &amp; API's
***
Display Gifs of my favorite Western films/shows, and allow others to search for more.
***
Lessons learned from this exercise:<br>
    1) Correct syntax of the api key is essential. Incorrect api key syntax makes for a long day.
    2) Aside from debugging, hardest part was thinking of a topic which was gif-able.
***
"Gif" is pronounced with a hard g (like grab, or gift, or gills) because grammar and pronunciation
  are determined, ultimately, by popular usage rather than by decree.
